Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, costing billions annually and undermining consumer trust. With the rise of digital transactions, detecting fraudulent activities in real-time has become critical. Machine learning offers powerful tools to identify suspicious patterns and anomalies in transaction data, enabling proactive fraud prevention.

This project aims to analyze a dataset of credit card transactions (likely from Kaggle) to build a predictive model that distinguishes between legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with fraud cases representing a tiny fraction (<1%) of transactions, posing challenges for model performance. We will explore techniques like:

-Data preprocessing (scaling, handling class imbalance).

-Feature engineering (time-based features, dimensionality reduction if needed).

-Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).

-Evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC) suited for imbalanced data.

-By leveraging these methods, we aim to create a robust model that minimizes false negatives (missed frauds) while maintaining high accuracy.
